scratchbar
==========

In audio processing, a "window" is a way of looking at a small piece of a larger track, much as your browser window shows you a small piece of a larger webpage. Combine that metaphor with the fever-dream fantasy of the cursor-hand dragging a scrollbar up and down like a turntablist scratching a record, and you have scratchbar.

scratchbar lets you loop bits of audio, using the browser window as an (unapologetically perverse) interface. Resize the window vertically to change the loop size; scroll up and down to change the loop offset. Try making the window very short for granular effects, or open multiple windows and recreate Reich's early [phasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_Out_%28Reich%29) [works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Gonna_Rain) in HTML5.
